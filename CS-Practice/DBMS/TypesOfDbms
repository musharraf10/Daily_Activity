Alright 👍 let’s explore the **classical data models** used in databases step by step.

# 🧠 Theory: Data Models in DBMS

A **data model** defines **how data is structured, organized, and related** inside a database.
Historically, several models were developed before we got to the modern **Relational Model**.

## 🔹 1. Hierarchical Data Model

- **Structure**: Data is organized in a **tree-like structure** (parent–child).
- Each parent can have multiple children, but each child has only **one parent**.
- Access is **navigational**: you must traverse the hierarchy to reach data.

✅ Example:

```
Company
 ├── Department A
 │    ├── Employee 1
 │    ├── Employee 2
 └── Department B
      ├── Employee 3
      └── Employee 4
```

**Advantages**:

- Fast for hierarchical queries.
- Good for representing real-world tree-like relationships.

**Disadvantages**:

- Inflexible (hard to reorganize).
- Many-to-many relationships are difficult.

**Use case**: Early IBM IMS (used in banking, airlines).

## 🔹 2. Network Data Model

- **Structure**: Data is represented as a **graph** (records as nodes, relationships as edges).
- Unlike hierarchical model, a child can have **multiple parents**.
- Relationships are stored as **pointers/links** between records.

✅ Example:

```
Student --(enrolls)--> Course
Course  --(taught_by)-> Professor
```

**Advantages**:

- Can represent more complex relationships (many-to-many).
- Faster navigation than relational for certain queries.

**Disadvantages**:

- Still navigational: user must know how data is connected.
- Complex to manage and query.

**Use case**: CODASYL DBTG model (1960s–70s).

## 🔹 3. Relational Data Model

- **Structure**: Data is organized into **tables (relations)** with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).
- Relationships are expressed using **foreign keys**, not pointers.
- Queries are written in **SQL (declarative)**, not navigational.

✅ Example:
**Student Table**

| StudentID | Name | Age |
| --------- | ---- | --- |
| 1         | Alex | 20  |
| 2         | Riya | 21  |

**Course Table**

| CourseID | Title |
| -------- | ----- |
| 101      | DBMS  |
| 102      | AI    |

**Enrollment Table**

| StudentID | CourseID |
| --------- | -------- |
| 1         | 101      |
| 1         | 102      |
| 2         | 101      |

**Advantages**:

- Simpler, flexible, and widely adopted.
- Powerful querying with SQL.
- Data independence (logical model separated from physical storage).

**Disadvantages**:

- Performance overhead for very large or complex relationships compared to specialized models.

**Use case**: Almost all modern RDBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle).

## 🔹 4. Entity-Relationship (E-R) Model

- Conceptual model (not storage).
- Uses **entities (objects)**, **attributes (properties)**, and **relationships**.
- Often used in **database design** before converting to relational schema.

✅ Example:

```
Student (Entity)
  └─ attributes: StudentID, Name, Age
Course (Entity)
  └─ attributes: CourseID, Title
Relationship: Enrolls (between Student and Course)
```

## 🔹 5. Object-Oriented Data Model

- Combines **object-oriented programming concepts** with databases.
- Data represented as **objects** (with attributes + methods).
- Supports complex data types (images, multimedia).

**Use case**: Object databases (e.g., db4o), some features in PostgreSQL.

## 🔹 6. Document, Key-Value, Graph (NoSQL models)

In modern systems:

- **Key-Value Model** → like a dictionary (Redis).
- **Document Model** → JSON-like documents (MongoDB).
- **Graph Model** → nodes + edges (Neo4j).

| Model           | Structure              | Query Style       | Best for                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Hierarchical    | Tree (1-to-many)       | Navigational      | Tree-like data (org chart, XML) |
| Network         | Graph (many-to-many)   | Navigational      | Complex relationships           |
| Relational      | Tables                 | Declarative (SQL) | General-purpose, standard DBs   |
| E-R             | Conceptual             | N/A (design)      | Database design stage           |
| Object-Oriented | Objects                | OOP + Queries     | Multimedia, CAD, scientific     |
| NoSQL           | Key-Value, JSON, Graph | APIs / custom     | Big Data, unstructured          |
